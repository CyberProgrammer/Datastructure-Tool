# Datastructure-Tool
This C++ code is for a program that performs various actions on a linked list and a vector, such as push, search, deleteNode, and readFile. The code includes a driver function and a linearSearch function. The readFile function reads data from a file and stores it in the vector. There's also a function to view the data stored in the vector.
